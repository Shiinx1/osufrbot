# osufrbot

osufrbot was a Discord Bot, created to manage a community server revolving around the game Osu!
It uses Discord's Game Activity to retrieve player's in-game names and their global rank, in each game mode. It also has an upvote and rating system of avatars, and users can also vote for the new server's logo.
It filters, after execution, the least liked avatars, and remove them, then saves the good ones to a folder. It gives specific roles depending on the in-game rank of the user. Has a power4 to kill some time.
